# Gradle for Android and Java Final Project



### Optional Components

Once you have a functioning project, consider adding more features to test your Gradle and Android skills. Here are a few suggestions:

* Make the free app variant display interstitial ads between the main activity and the joke-displaying activity.
* Have the app display a loading indicator while the joke is being fetched from the server.
* Write a Gradle task that starts the GCE dev server, runs all the Android tests, and shuts down the dev server.
